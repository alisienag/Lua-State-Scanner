# Lua-State-Scanner

Scans for Roblox Lua State by hooking a function the Lua function "index2adr".

I haven't confirmed this yet but it seems you need to call the print_to_console function, as it may or may not call the index2adr function and hence allows us to grab the lua state.

Use this as you please, just don't forget to give credits.

Ignore poor quality of coding, I needed a fast and decently reliable way to grab the Lua State.
